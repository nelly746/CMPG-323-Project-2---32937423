This project is a web API for IoT Device Management System

Overview
Smart devices such as voice controllers, security lights, smart locks and Wi-Fi-enabled devices
can communicate and exchange data over the Internet. Devices form distributed ecosystems that
can perform environmental monitoring of homes and buildings. The exposure of IoT device
capabilities and data through the Web is fundamental. An IoT Device Management System helps
you register, organise, monitor, and remotely manage IoT devices at scale as IoT deployments
range in size, complexity, objectives and requirements.
An IoT Device Management System keeps track of the whereabouts of all IoT devices deployed
by the organisation. Depending on the type of organisation, different categories of devices are
used. Each IoT device is initially categorised and registered. Then, IoT devices are deployed
throughout the organisation's buildings in predefined zones. Administrators can view all IoT
devices, update their properties, add new devices and move them to other zones.
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a model and architectural style for web services over
HTTP. When this model is used for API design, IoT devices can be managed using the Cloud.
Therefore, the IoT Device Management System should be implemented as a set of RESTful APIs.
RESTful APIs and services are used as a good practice in the industry to transport data between
systems, environments, interfaces and applications. One of the most common use cases is
connecting a RESTful API to a data source to manage interaction with the data source. This
approach lends many advantages to a solution mostly addressing longevity. RESTful APIs
commonly consist of different methods that allow for retrieval of data and manipulation of data
(creation, amendment and deletion).
As part of this project, you will create a CRUD RESTful API that will connect to a database storing
IoT device data. The API should contain at least one get, post, patch and delete method per
resource â€“ aligning to the project's requirements. The RESTful API architecture has several
endpoints called over HTTP, invoking application code to update a database
