# CMPG-323-Project-2---32937423
This project is a web API for IoT Device Management System

Overview
Overview Wi-Fi-enabled devices, security lights, smart locks, and voice controls are all just a few examples of smart devices that can communicate and exchange data over the Internet. Devices form distributed ecosystems that
can perform environmental monitoring of homes and buildings. The exposure of IoT device
capabilities and data through the Web is fundamental. Since IoT deployments vary in size, complexity, aims, and requirements, an IoT Device Management System enables you to register, organize, monitor, and remotely manage IoT devices at scale.
Each of the IoT devices that an organization has deployed are tracked by an IoT Device Management System. Depending on the type of organisation, different categories of devices are
used. Each IoT device is initially categorised and registered. Then, IoT devices are deployed
throughout the organisation's buildings in predefined zones. Administrators can view all IoT
devices, update their properties, add new devices and move them to other zones.
Representational State Transfer (REST) is a model and architectural style for web services over
HTTP. When this model is used for API design, IoT devices can be managed using the Cloud.
Therefore, the IoT Device Management System should be implemented as a set of RESTful APIs.
RESTful APIs and services are used as a good practice in the industry to transport data between
systems, environments, interfaces and applications. One of the most common use cases is
connecting a RESTful API to a data source to manage interaction with the data source. This
approach lends many advantages to a solution mostly addressing longevity. RESTful APIs
commonly consist of different methods that allow for retrieval of data and manipulation of data
(creation, amendment and deletion).
As part of this project, i will be designing a CRUD RESTful API that will connect to a database storing
IoT device data. This API will contain at least one get, post, patch and delete method per
resource – linking to the project's requirements. Several endpoints in the RESTful API architecture can be accessed over HTTP to call application code as well as to update databases.
